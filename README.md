# Metamorph Token
MMT is a ERC-721 non-fungible token made to incentivize deal sourcing within metamorph.
### How
Each contributor gets assigned an identity (key). Each deal gets assigned a token (ownership). A deal is a fully tradable asset within the organization. Depends on the deal, outside contributors can also be assigned a portion of the deal. Ownership is always tradable in real time.
### Why
It's cool because as deals come in, we are able to not only adaquately track the sources, but also track the conviction of each partner of the fund. Partners can actively trade these non-fungible tokens in real time, in a way, vote for deals they want to support. The rewards for each partner should be performance based and correlates with the outcomes of the deals, hence their stakes in each of the deals.
